### 3. **About Page (Build Trust)**

# About [Your Name]

[Professional Photo - trading desk setup]

## My Trading Journey

I started trading in 2014 with $5,000. Like most beginners, I lost 70% in the first 6 months.

But I didn't give up.

I studied every strategy, read 50+ books, took 10+ courses, and spent $20k+ on my education.

**The turning point came in 2016** when I developed my own risk management system.

Since then:
- ✅ 8 consecutive profitable years
- ✅ Average 15-25% annual returns
- ✅ Taught 2,500+ students
- ✅ Verified track record on Myfxbook

## Why I Created This Course

I wished someone had taught me these strategies 10 years ago. It would have saved me $15k in losses and 3 years of trial and error.

This course is **everything I wish I knew** when I started.

## My Philosophy

1. **Risk first, profits second** - Preserve capital above all
2. **Quality over quantity** - 5 great trades beat 50 mediocre ones
3. **Psychology matters** - 80% mental game, 20% technical

## Verifiable Track Record

[Link to Myfxbook account] *(public, verified)*

- Win rate: 62%
- Risk/Reward: 1:2.5 average
- Max drawdown: 8%
- Sharpe ratio: 2.1
