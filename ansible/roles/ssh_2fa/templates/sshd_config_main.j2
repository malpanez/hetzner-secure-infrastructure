# SSH Server Configuration
# Managed by Ansible - ssh_2fa role
#
# This is a minimal main configuration file.
# All actual configuration is done via drop-in files in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/
#
# Drop-in files are loaded in alphanumeric order:
# - 50-2fa.conf (if 2FA is enabled)
# - 99-hardening.conf (security hardening)
#
# To customize, add your own files to /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ with appropriate numbering:
# - 00-*.conf (loaded first, can be overridden)
# - 50-*.conf (normal priority)
# - 99-*.conf (high priority, loaded last)

# Include drop-in configuration files
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf

# Default settings (can be overridden by drop-ins)
# These are Debian defaults and serve as fallback
